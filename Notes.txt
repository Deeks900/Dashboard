Routing in angular
Define your routes in your Routes array.
Each route in this array is a JavaScript object that contains two properties. The first property, path, defines the URL path for the route.
A child route is like any other route, in that it needs both a path and a component. The one difference is that you place child routes in a children array within the parent route.
