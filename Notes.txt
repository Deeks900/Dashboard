Routing in angular
Define your routes in your Routes array.
Each route in this array is a JavaScript object that contains two properties. The first property, path, defines the URL path for the route.
A child route is like any other route, in that it needs both a path and a component. The one difference is that you place child routes in a children array within the parent route.
ng g c shared/components/sidebar
ng g c shared/components/header
ng g c shared/components/footer
ng g m shared
npm i -s @angular/flex-layout @angular/cdk
ng g c modules/posts

Nice doc.

@Input() and @Output() give a child component a way to communicate with its parent component. @Input() lets a parent component update data in the child component. Conversely, @Output() lets the child send data to a parent component.
The child component uses the @Output() property to raise an event to notify the parent of the change. To raise an event, an @Output() must have the type of EventEmitter, which is a class in @angular/core that you use to emit custom events.
